Hi, I’m @banditofsmoke 👋

About Me I'm a developer with a passion for building intelligent systems, specializing in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models. My expertise lies in designing and implementing scalable, efficient, and secure RAG systems.

Tech Stack 🔧 I'm proficient in a range of programming languages and technologies, including:

Python: Familiar with popular libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.
JavaScript: Experienced with Node.js and React.
FastAPI: Knowledgeable about building fast, scalable, and secure APIs.
MongoDB: Skilled in data modeling, querying, and schema design.
RAG Expertise 🔩 I have extensive knowledge of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models, including:

Retrieval: Familiar with retrieval algorithms and techniques for retrieving relevant information.
Generation: Experienced with generation models and techniques for generating high-quality text.
Augmentation: Skilled in augmenting generation models with retrieved information to improve accuracy and relevance.
Upcoming Project 🔩 I'm excited to announce that my first open-source project, a RAG framework, is coming soon! This project aims to provide a comprehensive and scalable RAG solution for generating high-quality text. Stay tuned for updates and contributions!

Codebase 📁 My public GitHub repository will be a collection of code snippets, experiments, and projects that showcase my skills and expertise in RAG development. You can expect to see:

RAG framework code
Python scripts for RAG-related tasks
Node.js projects for building RAG-based applications


Fun Fact ⚡ In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and experimenting with innovative ideas for RAG development.
